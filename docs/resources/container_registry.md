# arcane_container_registry (Resource)

Manages an Arcane container registry.

Container registries in Arcane store credentials for authenticating with Docker registries
when pulling private images. Registries are configured globally and can be used across
all environments.

## Example Usage

```hcl
resource "arcane_container_registry" "ghcr" {
  name      = "GitHub Container Registry"
  url       = "https://ghcr.io"
  auth_type = "basic"
  username  = "my-github-user"
  password  = var.ghcr_token
}

resource "arcane_container_registry" "dockerhub" {
  name = "Docker Hub"
  url  = "https://index.docker.io/v1/"
}
```

## Import

Container registries can be imported using their ID:

```shell
terraform import arcane_container_registry.ghcr <registry-id>
```

**Note:** When importing, the password is not retrieved from the API. You will need to
re-supply the password in your configuration after import.

## Example Usage

```terraform
resource "arcane_container_registry" "ghcr" {
  name      = "GitHub Container Registry"
  url       = "https://ghcr.io"
  auth_type = "basic"
  username  = "my-github-user"
  password  = var.ghcr_token
}

resource "arcane_container_registry" "dockerhub" {
  name = "Docker Hub"
  url  = "https://index.docker.io/v1/"
}
```
