  Use this data source to look up a specific container within an Arcane environment.
  Containers can be looked up by ID or by name. When looking up by name, the data source
  searches across all projects in the environment (or a specific project if project_id is set).
  Example Usage
  Lookup by name
  
  data "arcane_container" "postgres" {
    environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
    name           = "postgres"
  }
  
  output "postgres_status" {
    value = data.arcane_container.postgres.status
  }
  
  Lookup by ID
  
  data "arcane_container" "app" {
    environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
    id             = "abc123"
  }

# arcane_container (Data Source)

Use this data source to look up a specific container within an Arcane environment.

Containers can be looked up by ID or by name. When looking up by name, the data source
searches across all projects in the environment (or a specific project if `project_id` is set).

## Example Usage

### Lookup by name

```hcl
data "arcane_container" "postgres" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  name           = "postgres"
}

output "postgres_status" {
  value = data.arcane_container.postgres.status
}
```

### Lookup by ID

```hcl
data "arcane_container" "app" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  id             = "abc123"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "arcane_container" "postgres" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  name           = "postgres"
}

output "postgres_status" {
  value = data.arcane_container.postgres.status
}
```
