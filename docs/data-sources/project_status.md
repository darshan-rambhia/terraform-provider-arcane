  Use this data source to query detailed runtime status of an Arcane project's containers.
  Unlike the arcane_project data source which returns basic service info, this data source
  provides container-level details including health checks, port mappings, and container IDs.
  Example Usage

    environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
    project_id     = data.arcane_project.webapp.id

# arcane_project_status (Data Source)

Use this data source to query detailed runtime status of an Arcane project's containers.

Unlike the `arcane_project` data source which returns basic service info, this data source
provides container-level details including health checks, port mappings, and container IDs.

## Example Usage

```hcl
data "arcane_project_status" "webapp" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  project_id     = data.arcane_project.webapp.id
}

output "container_health" {
  value = data.arcane_project_status.webapp.containers
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
data "arcane_project_status" "webapp" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  project_id     = data.arcane_project.webapp.id
}

output "container_health" {
  value = data.arcane_project_status.webapp.containers
}
```
