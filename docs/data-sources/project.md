# arcane_project (Data Source)

Use this data source to get information about an existing Arcane project.

Projects in Arcane represent Docker Compose stacks discovered within an environment.
You can look up a project by either its ID or name within an environment.

## Example Usage

### By ID

```hcl
data "arcane_project" "webapp" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  id             = "project-123"
}
```

### By Name

```hcl
data "arcane_project" "webapp" {
  environment_id = arcane_environment.production.id
  name           = "webapp"
}
```

## Example Usage

```terraform
# Look up an existing environment
data "arcane_environment" "production" {
  name = "production"
}

# Look up a project by name within the environment
data "arcane_project" "webapp" {
  environment_id = data.arcane_environment.production.id
  name           = "webapp"
}

# Look up a project by ID
data "arcane_project" "by_id" {
  environment_id = data.arcane_environment.production.id
  id             = "project-xyz789"
}

# Use the project data
output "project_status" {
  value = data.arcane_project.webapp.status
}

output "project_path" {
  value = data.arcane_project.webapp.path
}
```
